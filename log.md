# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 01/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started [Unreal with C++ Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsNW4FPHuZE&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) to get an overiview of how the editor works.

**Thoughts:** Skimmed over the C++ concepts I am not to confident with yet, as I can return to and review these in another session. Excited to understand the basics of C++ in Unreal so I can start making something of my own.

**Tomorrow's goals**: 
* Start attached video's refernce to video explaining contructors in C++. 
* Reviewing code written so far and understanding where everything comes from and what it does.

### Day 1: 02/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Felt rather off today and as a result, progress was rather slow. Spent most of my time fixing versioning in SourceTree and bug fixing my code from the video from yesterday.

**Thoughts:** I see why a lot of people go with Unity instead. C++ is daunting. Nonetheless I am still lookng forward to understanding this new syntax a little better

**Tomorrow's goals**: 
* Start attached video's refernce to video explaining contructors in C++. 
* Reviewing code written so far and understanding where everything comes from and what it does.

### Day 2: 03/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Only managed half an hour or so of a pointer tutorial, as I was rather tired. I then moved on to a section of TPP.

**Thoughts:** While I was sad to not make huge progress in Unreal, I am glad I was aware enough to realise that I wasn't being productive and to move on to something a little less technical

**Tomorrow's goals**: 
* Start more indepth FCC video on pointers
* remake Unreal repo and move to own github repo so can have active updates on Github activity

### Day 3: 06/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Took a day off yesterday to rethink if C++/Unreal is right for me and am instead moving back over to JS with a focus on making VR games in each fo the the three main VR frameworks. I am working towards winning the WebXR category of the js13kgames competetiion. 

**Thoughts:** I hate quiting something that I've really only jsut begun, but to be honest I am relieved I did. Now was not the time to start a whole new language and style of coding. Working with JS I am simultaneously improving my skills for work and personal web projects that I can show off sooner, as well as scratching the VR itch.

**Tomorrow's goals**: 
* move this log and other useful files from 100doc to own github repo so can have active updates on Github activity
* choose a frameowrk and make a repo
* get started with docs from that framework.

### Day 4: 07/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Made a repo to get started with a-fram, sorted Github repos/profile, and played about with hosting a remote server on my local etwork with http.server and ngrok 
**Thoughts:** Loving the switch and buzzing for tomorrow


**Link to work:** [a-frame repo](https://github.com/TimLafosse/a-frame_test)

**Tomorrow's goals**: 
* continue with a-frame walkthrough
* find easiest way to jump in to project on Quest 2 


### Day 5: 08/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Tried to get the a-frame-inspector up and running to allow me to easily edit stuff and live edit my code, but struggled, think I may need a different version of a-frame. Also joined slack groups and WebVR groups in the hope of contributing more to the community.
**Thoughts:** Wasn't feeling it too much today and had a little doubt cast in to my mind. I must ignore these feelings and keep working though


**Link to work:** [a-frame repo](https://github.com/TimLafosse/a-frame_test)

**Tomorrow's goals**: 
* get a-frame-inspector and live edit working
* find easiest way to jump in to project on Quest 2 

### Day 6: 09/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Managed to get the inspector working after unearthing that my keyboard wasn't correct for the shortcut to work. I also got the watcher working but decided against it as it uses an older version of a-frame. A-frame also inspector allows editing in the borwser and easy copying of the resulting html
**Thoughts:** Was close to giving up on the inspector but am glad I stuck it out. Feeling mor clear in my mind that this is the way forward. I am buying low and selling high on this budding technology, and investing in my knowledge portfolio


**Link to work:** [a-frame repo](https://github.com/TimLafosse/a-frame_test)

**Tomorrow's goals**: 
* Play about with editing code of games in js13k that used a-frame
* find easiest way to jump in to project on Quest 2 

### Day 7: 10/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Found out I was using an old version of the inspector (0.7.0) and not the most recent (1.1.0) which meant that 
**Thoughts:** Was close to giving up on the inspector but am glad I stuck it out. Feeling mor clear in my mind that this is the way forward. I am buying low and selling high on this budding technology, and investing in my knowledge portfolio


**Link to work:** [a-frame repo](https://github.com/TimLafosse/a-frame_test)

* 
* Play about with editing code of games in js13k that used a-frame
* try and minify + strip down spiderman code (make a smaller room + platforms)
* find easiest way to jump in to project on Quest 2 

### Day 8: 11/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about assets and how they are hosted and retireved with CORS (albeit a lot of it went over my head). A very useful concept to cover in more detail at a later point. I also check out the WebXR games hosted on consructarcade by the chaps who host White Rabbit XR podcast
**Thoughts:** Didn't feel great today, but more generally in my self than anything code related. Doesn't help that I am not feeling too well. Nevertheless, I am happy with the progress I am making and look forward to producing a a project worthy of constructarcade

* find easiest way to jump in to project on Quest 2 

### Day 9: 12/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Needed a lie in so I split my hour in to two today, the first half I looked further in to CORS, HTTP and the Web on MDN (really great resource provider), also read some Prag Prog. Finished by looking at some A-frame school
**Thoughts:** Splitting my hour wasn't a good decision. It meant that anxieties and doubt related to work and other aspects of life crept in, making it hard to focus in the latter half. Doubted my VR passion somewhat today. I must remember that while I made the correct) decision to not get in to Unreal/Unity game development, it doesn't mean I need to turn away form CR in passion projects completely. Keep going, it will be worth it.

### Day 10: 13/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Intended to push on with a-frame school but got distracted with trying to get aframe-watcher to work, which I largely did. I also posted my first issue on github which was exciting.
**Thoughts:** I am glad I stuck out trying to get the watcher working as best I can. Having it partially working is better than not at all.


**Link to work:** [a-frame repo](https://github.com/TimLafosse/a-frame_test)

**Tomorrow's goals**:

### Day 11: 14/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on adding animations and other things from the A-frame Registry. THese will no doubt come in useful when I make my game.
**Thoughts:** Didn't find the Registry stuff to interesting today. The design element of game development doesn't appeal to me. I look forward to diving in to JS and linking that to my work.

### Day 12: 15/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Continued on A-frame school and picked up some JS again. Played with the querySelector and setAttribute methods + plus the added functionality A-frame has built in to the JS methods.
**Thoughts:** Was refreshing to work with some JS code again. I feel a little more motivated to keep going today, now that I've had a glimpse at how technologies I am familiar with can be used with A-frame 

**Link to work:** [a-frame repo](https://github.com/TimLafosse/a-frame_test)

### Day 13: 16/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Decided to spend some time writing a script that will allow me to add log entries automatically to this file, which will make finishing up one of my 100 Days that much faster. Strugglign to link my Ruby SDK to Rubymine
**Thoughts:** Glad I decided to do this little side project, it will be rewarding and make my life that much easier. Scripting is what got me started on coding, and I havent given myslef enough time to really enjoy it now that I am passed the beginner stage.

**Link to work:** [a-frame repo](https://github.com/TimLafosse/a-frame_test)

### Day 14: 17/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Managed to link the Ruby SDK to Rubymine and started creating a method that will pull out each line that includes a date in it
**Thoughts:** Getting Rubymine set up was more of a hassle than expected, but I am glad I did. JetBrains have some great IDEs and it will be nice to learn more about them in my free time.

### Day 17: 21/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: made simple methods with the aim of just making a simple, messy script that works
**Thoughts:** Writing something then refactoring is better than moving agonisingly slow and focussing on every tiny detail. Some good advice given was to start at the top level, keeping everything as simple as possible then work you're way down in to the weeds to hide complexity

**Link to work:** [100 Days of code](https://github.com/TimLafosse/100DaysOfCode)

### Day 18: 22/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: pcied up A-frame again and continued working through the school
**Thoughts:** Felt a lot doubt towards continuing on this project, I just don't feel as motivated as i did. Can't stop thinking about a reddit post about the lack of a need to create projects once you have a job in the industry. Maybe after this long I should just pick up an extra project at work to do in this time? I might be more motivated to keep going

### Day 19: 23/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Continued with A-frame school and spent most of the day trying to understand adding event listeners

### Day 20: 24/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Continued with A-frame school and spent most of the day still trying to understand adding event listeners. Mangaed to get an example working but got stuck on the one outlined in the docs and posted on slack for help
**Thoughts:** Really was not feeling well today but managed to stay as focusssed as I could. A-frame is really dragging. I really need to start work on a project soon

### Day 21: 26/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Answered a slack message that linked to the aframe-super-hands-component repo which gave a physics based example with an event listener. Couldn't quite get it working though
**Thoughts:** Glad I messaged the slack channel when I got stuck as the response that was given has led me to a resource rich with information on how more fleshed out examples look.

### Day 22: 31/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: After a lot of thinking I've decided to halt progress on A-frame for now. What is more important right now is improving my existing skills, namely in react. I have picked up my work on react-testing-library and also refreshed my knowledge on what the difference between React, ReactDOM and the DOM are.
**Thoughts:**  While it was fun exploring a completely new kind of coding and scratching a more creative itch with A-frame, I am glad to ve moving back to something that will benefit me professionally as well as personally.

### Day 26: 16/02/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Moved back to VSC due to IDEA community edition being too limited for JS development. Learnt about webpack production builds and why they are smaller and more efficient (use less source maps)
**Thoughts:** Feeling like I should just finish my old ReactJS tutorial in order to give me a baseline of an entire deployed app that I can then edit and reimplement features (e.g. AWS instead of Firebase). For now it is a good fallback for days liek today when I am tired and struggling to focus.

**Today's Progress**: Had a reading day and knocked out a chapter on Orthogonality in TPP today. Only thing left are the end of chapter exercises
**Thoughts:** Really enjoyed a change of activity and felt I tackled the chapter well considering I was still waking up. In the future I must be sure to not gloss over code fragments or section I don't fully understand

### Day 29: 21/02/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Used Heroku to deploy an app as well as how to seperate dev dependencies in package.json, separating those that I do not need in production e.g testing packages
**Thoughts:** Glad I am working through some of the extra bits of the react tutorial that are more to do with prouciton and 3rd party software rather than react development itslef. These will no doubt come in useful when I come to redeploy my app with AWS

### Day 30: 22/02/2021 

**Today's Progress**: pushed a feature that changes the date and currency format of expenses to something nicer using moment and another package that the name of has already slipped my mind 
**Thoughts:**  I've been slipping on giving myslef a full hour before work which is not ideal. I am still enjoying it a lot though and am feeling motivated to keep pushing forward

### Day 31-3: 01-03/03/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Read a few chapters of The pragmatic programmer, covering multiple inheritance, orthogonality, reversibility and domain languages. 
**Thoughts:**  Was glad to get back in to reading more TPP. The more I read, the easier it is to pick up again. The thing that has really stuck with me in the past week was a section on tracer bullets that included a diagram of the various layers of the software onion. From outside to in it goes, User Interface -> Authentication -> Business Logic -> Data Model -> Database. I knew all of these parts existed but had never seen them grouped together. It go me thinking about which parts of this cycel I enjoy the most. Having done a  lot of front end develoment at work recently. I'd certainly have to say that the UI/Authentication is what I prefer the most and am always the most happy to return to. Maybe it's my web dev roots or maybe I am just better at it. Who knows.

### Day 34: 05/03/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Picked up my expense app and did writing in JS for a feature which will add up all given expense for a given period as well as give he number of expenses
**Thoughts:** I need to give myslef more oppurtunities to write in JS. I'm feeling rather rusty

### Day 36: 09/03/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished totalling function and Jest/Enyme tests
**Thoughts:** Happy with the speed I managed to execute that feature. After only a week or so of spending more time in React, I already feel back in the swing of things

### Day 37: 18/03/2021 

**Today's Progress**: After getting stuck on a bug that turned out to be simply importing a function without {} around it, I finally managed to get a summary component working and now just need to finish off making tests for various kinds of expense inputs
**Thoughts:** Haven't been spending as much time as I'd like on this project. Starting work an hour earlier can seem appealing but it's really important to work on personal development as well.

### Day 38: 19/03/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished and refactored expense summary component to make it more readable and pull only the props needed from the Redux store instead of everything and pulling out bits later.
**Thoughts:** Very nearly moved on with a simple version that worked but would have been a nightmare to come back to or expand out. Refactoring is just as important as writing the code initally and should be given equal time in development
