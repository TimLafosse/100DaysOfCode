# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 01/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started [Unreal with C++ Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsNW4FPHuZE&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) to get an overiview of how the editor works.

**Thoughts:** Skimmed over the C++ concepts I am not to confident with yet, as I can return to and review these in another session. Excited to understand the basics of C++ in Unreal so I can start making something of my own.

**Tomorrow's goals**: 
* Start attached video's refernce to video explaining contructors in C++. 
* Reviewing code written so far and understanding where everything comes from and what it does.

### Day 1: 02/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Felt rather off today and as a result, progress was rather slow. Spent most of my time fixing versioning in SourceTree and bug fixing my code from the video from yesterday.

**Thoughts:** I see why a lot of people go with Unity instead. C++ is daunting. Nonetheless I am still lookng forward to understanding this new syntax a little better

### Day 2: 03/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Only managed half an hour or so of a pointer tutorial, as I was rather tired. I then moved on to a section of TPP.

**Thoughts:** While I was sad to not make huge progress in Unreal, I am glad I was aware enough to realise that I wasn't being productive and to move on to something a little less technical

**Tomorrow's goals**: 
* Start more indepth FCC video on pointers
* remake Unreal repo and move to own github repo so can have active updates on Github activity

### Day 3: 06/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Took a day off yesterday to rethink if C++/Unreal is right for me and am instead moving back over to JS with a focus on making VR games in each fo the the three main VR frameworks. I am working towards winning the WebXR category of the js13kgames competetiion. 

**Thoughts:** I hate quiting something that I've really only jsut begun, but to be honest I am relieved I did. Now was not the time to start a whole new language and style of coding. Working with JS I am simultaneously improving my skills for work and personal web projects that I can show off sooner, as well as scratching the VR itch.

**Tomorrow's goals**: 
* move this log and other useful files from 100doc to own github repo so can have active updates on Github activity
* choose a frameowrk and make a repo
* get started with docs from that framework.

### Day 4: 07/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Made a repo to get started with a-fram, sorted Github repos/profile, and played about with hosting a remote server on my local etwork with http.server and ngrok 
**Thoughts:** Loving the switch and buzzing for tomorrow


**Link to work:** [a-frame repo](https://github.com/TimLafosse/a-frame_test)

**Tomorrow's goals**: 
* continue with a-frame walkthrough
* find easiest way to jump in to project on Quest 2
