# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 01/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started [Unreal with C++ Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsNW4FPHuZE&feature=emb_logo&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) to get an overiview of how the editor works.

**Thoughts:** Skimmed over the C++ concepts I am not to confident with yet, as I can return to and review these in another session. Excited to understand the basics of C++ in Unreal so I can start making something of my own.

**Tomorrow's goals**: 
* Start attached video's refernce to video explaining contructors in C++. 
* Reviewing code written so far and understanding where everything comes from and what it does.

### Day 1: 02/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Felt rather off today and as a result, progress was rather slow. Spent most of my time fixing versioning in SourceTree and bug fixing my code from the video from yesterday.

**Thoughts:** I see why a lot of people go with Unity instead. C++ is daunting. Nonetheless I am still lookng forward to understanding this new syntax a little better

### Day 2: 03/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Only managed half an hour or so of a pointer tutorial, as I was rather tired. I then moved on to a section of TPP.

**Thoughts:** While I was sad to not make huge progress in Unreal, I am glad I was aware enough to realise that I wasn't being productive and to move on to something a little less technical

**Tomorrow's goals**: 
* Start more indepth FCC video on pointers
* remake Unreal repo and move to own github repo so can have active updates on Github activity

### Day 3: 06/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Took a day off yesterday to rethink if C++/Unreal is right for me and am instead moving back over to JS with a focus on making VR games in each fo the the three main VR frameworks. I am working towards winning the WebXR category of the js13kgames competetiion. 

**Thoughts:** I hate quiting something that I've really only jsut begun, but to be honest I am relieved I did. Now was not the time to start a whole new language and style of coding. Working with JS I am simultaneously improving my skills for work and personal web projects that I can show off sooner, as well as scratching the VR itch.

**Tomorrow's goals**: 
* move this log and other useful files from 100doc to own github repo so can have active updates on Github activity
* choose a frameowrk and make a repo
* get started with docs from that framework.

### Day 4: 07/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Made a repo to get started with a-fram, sorted Github repos/profile, and played about with hosting a remote server on my local etwork with http.server and ngrok 
**Thoughts:** Loving the switch and buzzing for tomorrow


**Link to work:** [a-frame repo](https://github.com/TimLafosse/a-frame_test)

**Tomorrow's goals**: 
* continue with a-frame walkthrough
* find easiest way to jump in to project on Quest 2 


### Day 5: 08/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Tried to get the a-frame-inspector up and running to allow me to easily edit stuff and live edit my code, but struggled, think I may need a different version of a-frame. Also joined slack groups and WebVR groups in the hope of contributing more to the community.
**Thoughts:** Wasn't feeling it too much today and had a little doubt cast in to my mind. I must ignore these feelings and keep working though


**Link to work:** [a-frame repo](https://github.com/TimLafosse/a-frame_test)

**Tomorrow's goals**: 
* get a-frame-inspector and live edit working
* find easiest way to jump in to project on Quest 2 

### Day 6: 09/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Managed to get the inspector working after unearthing that my keyboard wasn't correct for the shortcut to work. I also got the watcher working but decided against it as it uses an older version of a-frame. A-frame also inspector allows editing in the borwser and easy copying of the resulting html
**Thoughts:** Was close to giving up on the inspector but am glad I stuck it out. Feeling mor clear in my mind that this is the way forward. I am buying low and selling high on this budding technology, and investing in my knowledge portfolio

**Tomorrow's goals**: 
* Play about with editing code of games in js13k that used a-frame
* find easiest way to jump in to project on Quest 2 

### Day 7: 10/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Found out I was using an old version of the inspector (0.7.0) and not the most recent (1.1.0) which meant that 
**Thoughts:** Was close to giving up on the inspector but am glad I stuck it out. Feeling mor clear in my mind that this is the way forward. I am buying low and selling high on this budding technology, and investing in my knowledge portfolio

**Tomorrow's goals**: 
* 
* Play about with editing code of games in js13k that used a-frame
* try and minify + strip down spiderman code (make a smaller room + platforms)
* find easiest way to jump in to project on Quest 2 

### Day 8: 11/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about assets and how they are hosted and retireved with CORS (albeit a lot of it went over my head). A very useful concept to cover in more detail at a later point. I also check out the WebXR games hosted on consructarcade by the chaps who host White Rabbit XR podcast
**Thoughts:** Didn't feel great today, but more generally in my self than anything code related. Doesn't help that I am not feeling too well. Nevertheless, I am happy with the progress I am making and look forward to producing a a project worthy of constructarcade

### Day 9: 12/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Needed a lie in so I split my hour in to two today, the first half I looked further in to CORS, HTTP and the Web on MDN (really great resource provider), also read some Prag Prog. Finished by looking at some A-frame school
**Thoughts:** Splitting my hour wasn't a good decision. It meant that anxieties and doubt related to work and other aspects of life crept in, making it hard to focus in the latter half. Doubted my VR passion somewhat today. I must remember that while I made the correct) decision to not get in to Unreal/Unity game development, it doesn't mean I need to turn away form CR in passion projects completely. Keep going, it will be worth it.

### Day 10: 13/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Intended to push on with a-frame school but got distracted with trying to get aframe-watcher to work, which I largely did. I also posted my first issue on github which was exciting.
**Thoughts:** I am glad I stuck out trying to get the watcher working as best I can. Having it partially working is better than not at all.


**Link to work:** [a-frame repo](https://github.com/TimLafosse/a-frame_test)

**Tomorrow's goals**: 

* FUrther investigate extent of aframe-watcher bug 
* Finish A-frame school so I can start on game

* find easiest way to jump in to project on Quest 2 
* watch fcc video on js13kgames winners

### Day 11: 14/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on adding animations and other things from the A-frame Registry. THese will no doubt come in useful when I make my game.
**Thoughts:** Didn't find the Registry stuff to interesting today. The design element of game development doesn't appeal to me. I look forward to diving in to JS and linking that to my work.

### Day 12: 15/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Continued on A-frame school and picked up some JS again. Played with the querySelector and setAttribute methods + plus the added functionality A-frame has built in to the JS methods.
**Thoughts:** Was refreshing to work with some JS code again. I feel a little more motivated to keep going today, now that I've had a glimpse at how technologies I am familiar with can be used with A-frame 

**Link to work:** [a-frame repo](https://github.com/TimLafosse/a-frame_test)

**Tomorrow's goals**:

### Day 13: 16/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Decided to spend some time writing a script that will allow me to add log entries automatically to this file, which will make finishing up one of my 100 Days that much faster. Strugglign to link my Ruby SDK to Rubymine
**Thoughts:** Glad I decided to do this little side project, it will be rewarding and make my life that much easier. Scripting is what got me started on coding, and I havent given myslef enough time to really enjoy it now that I am passed the beginner stage.

**Link to work:** [a-frame repo](https://github.com/TimLafosse/a-frame_test)

**Tomorrow's goals**: 

* Create a Ruby script that adds a new log entry to here + tidy up this docs formatting

### Day 14: 17/01/2021 

**Today's Progress**: Managed to link the Ruby SDK to Rubymine and started creating a method that will pull out each line that includes a date in it
**Thoughts:** Getting Rubymine set up was more of a hassle than expected, but I am glad I did. JetBrains have some great IDEs and it will be nice to learn more about them in my free time.
